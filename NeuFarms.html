<!-- PROJECT OVERVIEW -->
<div class="Content">
  <h1>NeuFarms App Visual Design</h1>
  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p><span class="emph">Goal: </span>NeuFarms aims to grow produce near the
    customer in hydroponic greenhouses. Neufarms needs a mobile app that will
    allow customers to interface with the greenhouse and grow exactly
     what they want, when they want.</p>
  <p><span class="emph">Team: </span><ul class="team">
    <li>Nate Folsom (me) — Visual Designer, Project Manager, Information Architect</li>
    <li>Stephanie Mathison — User Researcher</li>
    <li>Same Caldwell — Interaction Designer</li></ul></p>
  <p><span class="emph">Duration: </span>Three weeks.
     <p>During our initial meeting with the client, it became clear
       that I would be developing the branding for NeuFarms in addition
       to my aforementioned roles.</p>
     </div>

<!-- PROJECT MANAGEMENT -->
<div class="Content">
    <img class="contentImg hasBorder topper right" src="neufarms/SoW.jpg"/>
    <h2>Project Management</h2>
       <p>As the project manager, I kicked off the project with a team meeting.
         We discussed deliverables and deadlines in order to create a
         statement of work that could be sent to the client.</p>

         <p>Over the course of the project I was responsible for keeping in
           touch with the client through daily email updates, as well as
           arranging meetings. </p>
     </div>

<!-- FEATURE PRIORITIZATION -->
<div class="Content">
    <img class="contentImg left hasBorder topper" src="neufarms/featurePrio.png"/>
  <h2>Feature Prioritization</h2>
  <p>Fast-forward a bit in the project, we started to narrow down
    the MVP features for the app design. In order to do this, we brainstormed
    all possible features, including features that the client mentioned they
    were interested in including. Then, based on research, we sorted the
    features onto an Impact vs. Expectation matrix.</p>
  <p>Through this exercise, we found that the most important features
    would be those centered around monitoring and customizing produce. </p>
</div>

<!-- INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE -->
<div class="Content">
  <img class="contentImg hasBorder right topper" src="neufarms/CardSort.png"/>
  <h2>Information Architecture</h2>
  <p>In order to determine the names of the tabs in the app, I facilitated
    a card sort activity with the team. By sorting the features we decided
    upon previously, we came to the conclusion that there would be three tabs:
    My farm, monitor, and account. </p>
  <p><span class="emph">My Farm — </span>On this tab, users will be able to
    start a new farm, manage their current farm, and see what actions are
    currently being taken on their plants through an activity log.</p>
  <p><span class="emph">Monitor — </span>Plant progress, carbon footprint,
    farm livestream, and other data related to plant growth can be found
    on this tab.</p>
  <p><span class="emph">Account — </span>Users will be able to receive support
    and edit important information such as delivery and payment on this
    navigation tab.</p>
</div>

<!-- RESEARCH -->
<div class="Content">
  <h2>Visual Design — Research</h2>
  <p>Outside of these team activities, I was also researching agricultural
    visual design and branding on my own. Some of the places that I looked
    included CSA websites, gardening apps, and agricultural marketing agencies.
    <img class="contentImgL left wrapped" src="neufarms/visR.png"/>
    Common themes that I noticed included agricultural imagery and the
    use of certain colors. Green was used extensively for backgrounds and some
    calls to action. Warm colors were also prevalent in calls to action.
    From these sources it became clear that the NeuFarms should incorporate
    some of the same.</p>
</div>

<!-- LOGO DEVELOPMENT -->
<div class="Content">
  <img class="contentImg left hasBorder topper" src="neufarms/logo1.png"/>
  <h2>Logo Development</h2>
  <p>During the first week I also started working on a logo based off of
    concept sketches that the client had proivided. I started off by hand
    sketching and exploring new ideas around the theme.</p>
    <img class="contentImg right wrapped" src="neufarms/logo2.png"/>
    <p>After I had established a clear design direction, I took my sketching
    into into Adobe Illustrator for further iteration and refinement.
    Throughought the process I kept the client up to date on logo work to
    make sure that the design direction aligned with their vision of
    the NeuFarms brand.</p>
</div>

<!-- BRAND IDENTITY -->
<div class="Content">
  <img class="contentImgS right hasBorder wrapped" src="neufarms/BrandingCards.png"/>
  <h2>Brand Identity</h2>
  <p>In order to solidify the brand identity, I sat down with the
    client and facilitated a branding card activity. </p>
    <p>After some further refining via email, we settled on the
      words Sustainable, Custom, and Empowering.</p>
</div>

<!-- MOODBOARD -->
<div class="Content">
  <img class="contentImgL left topper" src="neufarms/MoodboardIteration.png"/>
  <h2>Moodboard</h2>
  <p>To further create the brand identity, I put together a moodboard
    using images that the client provided. In order to get the images,
    I asked the client to send me images that they felt represented the
    brand identity. Going through several iterations, I refined the moodbaord
    until each theme was represented, but not more than once.</p>
</div>

<!-- COLOR SELECTION -->
<div class="Content">
  <img class="contentImg right wrapped" src="neufarms/Color Selection.png"/>
  <h2>Color Selection</h2>
  <p>After the images were condensed down to a place I was happy with,
     I pulled colors from the moodboard for a color palette. </p>
  <p>I chose colors that would represent a sunny day on a farm. </p>

<!-- COLOR PALETTE -->
</div>
<div class="Content">
  <img class="contentImgL left wrapped" src="neufarms/ColorPalette.png" />
  <h2>Color Palette</h2>
  <p> Next I created four extra shades of each color that could be used in
    illustrations as highlights/lowlights or in the screen designs.</p>
</div>

<!-- TYPOGRAPHY -->
<div class="Content">
  <img class="contentImgS right topper" src="neufarms/Typography.png"/>
  <h2>Typography</h2>
  <p>For the text in the NeuFarms app I decided to use the system font,
    San Francisco, because we are designing for an iPhone app. SF has a
    familir look that will help welcome customers to the app, and a it has
    been carefully designed for legibility on phone displays. It also has
    the sleek Apple feel to it, which fits in nicelyto the NeuFarms brand. </p>
</div>

<!-- SCREEN ELEMENTS -->
<div class="Content">
  <img class="contentImg right topper" src="neufarms/Elements.png"/>
  <h2>Screen Elements</h2>
  <p>Using the colors and an initial wireframe I started experimenting
    with colors for the background, header bar, and tab bar. A blue sky
    gradient header bar, off-white background with sprout rows, and a light
    green tab bar.</p>

    <p>In order to create a more polished appearance and game-ified/fun
      atmosphere within the app, I created a set of icons that would
      represent produce. <img class="contentImgL left wrapped" src="neufarms/NFScreens.png"/>
      There is a small version of each icon which can
       be used as a visual representation of farm blocks allotted to each
       crop. The larger icons are used for representing crops during the
       selection and management process.</p>
    <p> The UI elements include a variety of boxes, cards and buttons.
      The UI elements all use a 10px corner radius in order to make them
      more visually appealing. For the action buttons, I used a slight
      gradient in order to give additional depth and make them more appealing
      to tap on. </p>


<!-- STYLE GUIDE -->
</div>
<div class="Content">
  <img class="contentImgL left topper" src="neufarms/Style Guide.png"/>
  <h2>Style Guide</h2>
  <p> I compiled all of my design elements and choices into a style
    guide for the client. This can be used to inform future work on
    the app and make sure that any new branding content is consistent
    with the material that I produced. </p>
</div>

<!-- NEXT STEPS -->
<div class="Content">
  <h2>Next Steps</h2>
  <p>In order to begin gaining interest and potential customers, Neufarms
    needs to create a "smoke test." Without any need to invest in app
    development or constructing a farm, NeuFarms can gauge interest in their
    product and adjust accordingly. In order to do this, screens from our app
    design will be used to create a concept product that can be sold to people.
    As Visual Designer, my next steps in the product would be to use the
    brand styling that I developed in order to create an appealing piece
    of content to send out to market.</p>
